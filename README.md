# The Halley Trail

Welcome to the future. After decades of venturing out into the great beyond, humanity decides they will attempt to build a colony on Europa. After years of researching how to reach this far off moon, scientists realized if a ship could make it to Halley's Comet, they could then hitch a ride through the galaxy.

Finally, it's July 28, 2061. The orbit of Halley's Comet is approaching perihelion for first time in 75 years, putting it within range of our best spaceships. You have been chosen as the captain on this voyage and are given a top of the line spacecraft to travel through the cosmos. You even get to christen it!

Your mission is as follows: pilot your ship to Halley's Comet as it passes near Earth, land on the icy surface, and hitch a ride to Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. Don't let your command be vaporized by asteroids!

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to control your ship's movement in the X and Y axes (you can't change your actual acceleration at light speed!). Dodge the asteroids so your crew can colonize the distant moon!

## Technology

Built using the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/), all code is written in [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html).

To run the project download it, open the Godot editor, import using the project.godot file, then hit F5. (The standard method, but worth describing just in case anyone stumbles across this who doesn't know.)

## Future Goals

* Add more specific resource management (e.g. fuel, ammo, repairs, etc)

* Implement waypoints along the journey to Halley's Comet

* Implement more encounters (alien ships, system malfunctions, etc)

## Challenges

* To create the illusion of motion in the setup screens, originally I had the background rotating around the camera as it looked at the ship from a side view. However, this didn't work from a rear view (3/4) because the ship appeared to be spinning.

* Once I realized the rotating background wouldn't work consistently I got pretty hung up on how to handle the movement of the ship in a way that was aesthetically pleasing while still playable.

* Limiting the scope enough to actually work on legit features! I had a whole huge idea but because I got stuck on silly roadblocks, I ended up only getting to a few pieces of it. I'm determined to keep going on this project though.
