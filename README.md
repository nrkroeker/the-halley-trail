# The Halley Trail

Welcome to the future. After decades of venturing out into the great beyond, humanity decides they will attempt to build a colony on Europa. After years of researching how to reach this far off moon, scientists realized if a ship could make it to Halley's Comet, they could then hitch a ride through the galaxy along it's orbit.

Finally, it's July 28, 2061. The orbit of Halley's Comet is approaching perihelion for first time in 75 years, putting it within range of our best spaceships. You have been chosen as the captain on this voyage and are given a top of the line spacecraft to travel through the cosmos. You even get to christen it!

Your mission is as follows: pilot your ship to Halley's Comet as it passes near Earth, land on the icy surface, and hitch a ride to Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. Don't let your command be vaporized by asteroids!

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to control your ship's movement in the X and Y axes (you can't change your actual acceleration at light speed!). Dodge the asteroids so your crew can colonize the distant moon!

## Technology

Built using the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/), all code is written in [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html).

To run the project, open the Godot editor & open this project, then hit F5. (The standard method, but worth describing just in case.)

## Future Goals

* Add resource management for fuel, ammo, and repairs

* Implement waypoints along the journey to Halley's Comet

* Implement more encounters (alien ships, system malfunctions, etc)

* Implement progress-saving 

## Challenges

* To create the illusion of motion in the setup screens, the background rotates around the camera - ideally, it would move smoothly from left to right without rotation. I haven't yet figured out how to get a similar forward motion illusion in the actual gameplay scenes.
